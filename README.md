## Chapter 4: Structural Variant Discovery in kākāpō125+ Data set
Reads were aligned to the kākāpō reference genome (VGP) using bwa. The W sex chromosome (present in females) was removed prior to alignments of males as the W is highly repetitive, and may contain regions that would result in misalignment of reads.

## Chapter 5: Towards a pangenome for enhanced SV discovery and genotyping in kākāpō
Brief summary of pangenome chapter
