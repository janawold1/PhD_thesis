# Structural Variants in a Conservation Context
Here are the scripts used for analyses in each Chapter of my thesis. Within each directory is a brief summary and all scripts used in analysis. 

## Chapter 3: Structural Variant Discovery in kākāpō125+ Data set
A nearly complete [short-read resequence data set](https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/kakapo-recovery/what-we-do/research-for-the-future/kakapo125-gene-sequencing/) and [high quality reference genome](https://vgp.github.io/genomeark/Strigops_habroptilus/) were used to investigate structual variantion (SVs) in the critically endangered kākāpō (*Strigops habroptilus*). Structural variants were called using the Delly, Manta and SMOOVE pipelines.

## Chapter 4: Population genomics of two fairy tern subspecies (*Sternula nereis*)
A population genomics study of the threatened Australian fairy tern (*Sternula nereis nereis*) and the Nationally Critical tara iti (*S. n. davisae*). Here, we aligned whole-genome short-read resequence data to the chromosomally assembled reference genome for the [common tern](https://vgp.github.io/genomeark/Sterna_hirundo/) (*Sterna hirundo*) to explore relative levels of population diversity and differentiation for these threatened taxa.

## Chapter 5: Towards a kākāpō pangenome for enhanced SV discovery and genotyping
Brief summary of pangenome chapter
