# Chapter 5: Kākāpō long-read sequencing, genome assembly and SV discovery
Here are the steps I compared alingment-based approaches to SV discovery with pangenome graph contstruction in the critically endangered kākāpō. The quality of Oxford Nanopore long-read data used in an alignment-based approach for SV discovery, as well as *de novo* genome assembly and genome graph construction. 

## 1 ONT base calling and read quality statistics


## 2 SV discovery with a linear reference


## 3 *De novo* genome assembly and graph construction
